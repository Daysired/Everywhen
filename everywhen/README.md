## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

I have a clear idea of what I want to do with my application and I'm confident that I have the skills and knowledge to make it look and work the way I want to.

### Weaknesses:

Im not 100% comfortable using class components, so I will be mostly using functional components for my project.

### Opportunities:

This project will give me the opportunitity to test the skills I've learned over the past 2 weeks and solidify those concepts. It will also be an opportunity to create an application that can bring balance to users' lives by helping them assess their mental health while also staying organized, which is something that a lot of people struggle with including myself.

### Threats:

I have a hard time asking for help beacuse I usually like to solve my problems on my own in order to learn more, but I end up spending a lot of time stuck in one problem. However, I will make sure to reach out to my squad lead for guidance when I feel stuck in order to use my time more efficiently.
